# Visual-Recognition-per-l-identificazione-e-la-classificazione-dei-tumori-cerebrali
This repository presents a project on classifying brain tumors (GBM vs. MET) from MRI images using pre-trained CNNs (ResNet, EfficientNet, VGG) integrated with IBMâ€™s Fuse-Med-ML and scikit-learn. It covers data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation on two MRI datasets (VOL and MULTI) as part of a Cognitive Computing Systems course.
